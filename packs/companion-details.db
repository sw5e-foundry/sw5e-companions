{"name":"Companions","content":"<h2>COMPANIONS</h2>\n<p>A companion is a creature who accompanies you on your adventures. It might take the form of a fearsome beast, a padawan learner, a droid sidekick, or a mischievous spirit. Some companions are an integral part of an archetype, while others are simple NPCs that characters encounter and adopt during their adventures.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h4>COMPANIONS IN YOUR GAME</h4>\n<p>Companions are not for the faint of heart. They add a significant power boost to a party, and can really bog down your game if their player’s are not prepared. You might choose to allow your players to use the companion archetypes, but not the feats, vice versa, both options, or none. It’s up to you.<br />Starting Equipment. Companions generally don’t start with any equipment, so it’s up to the player to gear their companion. For the sake of modesty, humanoid companion should probably start with a set of basic clothing, as appropriate.<br />Downtime Activities. Companions should not be able to perform downtime activities separately from their player’s character. However, companions should be able to help others perform their downtime activities. Additionally, a player can choose to have their companion perform a downtime activity, though their character must spend their downtime helping the companion.<br />Encounter Building and Experience Allocation. A companion’s level matches that of their owner, so they do not need to gain experience. However, you should consider treating a companion as half a character when building encounters and distributing experience. For instance, if your party is three characters and one companion, you should generate encounters and divide experience gained 3.5 ways, instead of simply three ways.<br />Enhanced Items. Companions should not count towards party size when allocating enhanced items. Additionally, while companion classes share names with their player character class counterparts, companions can not attune to items that require that class.<br />Starships and Deployments. Companions can not deploy as pilots, though they can fill other deployments as normal. Additionally, companions can gain deployment ranks, though they accrue prestige at half the rate of player characters, and they can not exceed 4 ranks in a deployment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>GAINING A COMPANION</h3>\n<p>Certain archetypes, such as the Astrotech Engineer, Saboteur Operative, or Zoologist Scholar, have their companions as the focus of their archetype’s features. Alternatively, a companion can be gained through taking the Companion Keeper feat, detailed later in this chapter.</p>\n<p>Regardless of how a companion is obtained, each player may have no more than one companion at a given time.</p>\n<h3>GENERATING YOUR COMPANION</h3>\n<p>First, you should determine your companion’s nature and appearance, as determined by your archetype feature or chosen from the list of companion natures if you take the Companion Keeper feat. Second, allocate your companion’s ability scores, as determined by its nature. Finally, you should generate your companion from 1st level using the follower class, and increase its level one level at a time, until its level equals your own. Be sure to update your companion’s hit points, ability scores, proficiency bonus, and any features it gains as it levels.</p>\n<h4>COMPANION NATURE</h4>\n<p>Your companion’s nature, discussed later in this chapter, is determined by your archetype feature or companion feat. Your companion’s nature determines its type, its hit points and Hit Dice, its proficiencies and other features, and its companion traits. At 1st level, your companion starts with two traits. It gains additional traits when it reaches higher levels, as shown in the follower table.</p>\n<h4>CLASS AND FEATURES</h4>\n<p>Your companion gains features when it reaches certain levels, as shown in the follower table.</p>\n<h4>LEVELING YOUR COMPANION</h4>\n<p>Your companion’s level equals your own, and each time you gain a level, so does your companion.</p>\n<h4>PROFICIENCY BONUS</h4>\n<p>Your companion’s proficiency bonus is equal to that of a player character of the same level, as shown in the follower table.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h4>STARTING EQUIPMENT</h4>\n<p>Generally speaking, companions are not intended to start with any equipment; it is up to you to outfit them as you deem appropriate. Humanoid companions should probably at least have clothing, however.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>COMPANIONS IN COMBAT</h3>\n<p>In combat, companions generally behave as a player character would, with the following differences.</p>\n<h4>ACTIONS IN COMBAT</h4>\n<p>Unless you use your bonus action to direct your companion, your companion can only use its action to Dash, Dodge, Disengage, Guard, or Hide.</p>\n<h4>COMPANION INITIATIVE</h4>\n<p>Both you and your companion roll initiative, but you act together on the lesser of the two results. You act on one turn, and you can each move or take actions in any order.</p>\n<h2>COMPANION NATURES</h2>\n<p>Certain class features grant a specific companion nature, while the Companion Keeper feat offers your choice of companion nature. You must meet a companion nature’s requirement in order to choose that companion. You may only have one active companion at a time.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<h4>ALTERNATIVE COMPANION NATURE</h4>\n<p>Your archetype feature may grant you one type of companion, whereas your character can be better realized utilizing a different companion. For instance, an astrotech engineer might prefer to have a tracker droid over one of the larger droid options. Work with your GM to determine if a different companion is better suited, and mechanically appropriate, to your character’s identity.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p> You may choose your companion’s nature from the following options or roll on the table below to determine it randomly.</p>\n<table style=\"width:29.9427%\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"width:31.5789%\">d10</th>\n<th style=\"width:68.4211%\">Companion Nature</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:31.5789%\">1</td>\n<td style=\"width:68.4211%\">Aberrant</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:31.5789%\">2</td>\n<td style=\"width:68.4211%\">Beast</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:31.5789%\">3</td>\n<td style=\"width:68.4211%\">Droid</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:31.5789%\">4</td>\n<td style=\"width:68.4211%\">Humanoid</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"width:30.2292%;height:85px\">\n<thead>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<th style=\"width:32.2275%;height:17px\">d10</th>\n<th style=\"width:67.7725%;height:17px\">Companion Nature</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:32.2275%;height:17px\">5</td>\n<td style=\"width:67.7725%;height:17px\">Spirit</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:32.2275%;height:17px\">6</td>\n<td style=\"width:67.7725%;height:17px\">Thrall</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:32.2275%;height:17px\">7</td>\n<td style=\"width:67.7725%;height:17px\">Tracker Droid</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:17px\">\n<td style=\"width:32.2275%;height:17px\">8</td>\n<td style=\"width:67.7725%;height:17px\">Turret</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>If you determine your companion’s nature randomly, and the result is a nature for which you are ineligible, simply reroll until you get a proper result.</p>\n<p>If your companion is irreparably destroyed, or you want a different companion, you must first break the bond with your current companion. Bonding with a new companion takes 8 hours spent in an appropriate location. You may only have one companion at a time.
