This module works with the current Player Character sheet to enable player's to build and utilize companions from the [Expanded Content](https://sw5e.com/rules/expandedContent/Customization%20Options) of SW5E. 
*Fair warning: these items heavily use active effects and the DAE module.*

### Companion Building Instructions

#### Class and Archetypes
You will start out by creating a Player Charatcer like normal, however, the ***only*** `Class` for this PC will be `Follower` found in the `Companion Classes` compendium. 

![Follower](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31608392/187972539-f121be85-743d-464d-94eb-4049f9959948.png)

The other entries in this compendium are classified as `Archetypes` of the `Follower` Class. Both the `Archetypes` and the `Class` have the advancement built in to grant the proper `Class Features` at the proper level. 

![Advancements](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31608392/187973246-d73b5e8c-e559-4332-8b97-cdbd192cc44f.png)

The `Archetype`s use Active Effects to add the proficiencies granted by such. 

![Active Effects](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31608392/187975570-4798bcff-be4d-436c-a3eb-d10b5d5ee9ec.png)

Certain `Class Feature`s have Active Effects that will be inactive because they will be granted at a higher level, such as the number of Superiority DIe that a Scholar can use or how many Force Powers a Consular knows. 
### *You will have to manually toggle these on as you reach the level the effect is granted*

### ***Please note that there is not an easy way to limit the amount of times you can cast a Leveled Power.***
You will have to add the Power from the Compendium and when the PC Casts it they will see this box:

![Slots](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/31608392/187983507-963052a2-b08b-4834-8299-5dd503d05799.png)

Please instruct the to uncheck the `Consume Power Slot?` box and then cast the power. You will also have to find a way to keep track of how many times they cast that power.

#### Natures
Companion natures are classified as `Species` in the system and use Active Effects to add/overide details.

#### Traits
Traits are classified as `Feat`s in the system and use Active Effects to add/overide details, even overriding the Active Effects from the Natures.

#### Weaponry
Some Natures and Classes grant weapons. The basic weapons granted can be found in the `Companion Weaponry` compendium.
